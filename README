What this is
============

A full-ish set of javascript helpers, intended just to avoid reimplementing anything DOM does except in situations where doing so will result in usefully less code.

The name is a reflection of the fact that this is not a derivative of any existing JS library or anything I do as work for my employer.

Licence
